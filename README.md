# Python-Game-Alien-Invasion
My first game programed in python!
Alien Invasion - A basic 2D computer game. (Based off the 80's arcade game Space Invaders). 
Here a player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom, center of the screen. The player can move the ship right, left, and forward using the arrow keys and the spacebar to shoot. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens will fill the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and tries to destroy the fleet of aliens. A new fleet will appear each time the screen is cleared, the ship is reset to the bottom center and a new fleet will appear that moves faster than the previous fleet one. If any alien hits the ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player looses a life. The player has three lives to achieve the highest score possible, and post your name on the leaderboard...let's see who takes the galaxy!
